# Setup

### Images

Some folders of images must be copied from a copy of Factorio:

* `Factorio/data/base/graphics/icons`

They should be copied into the `img` directory of Factorio Designer.

### Preprocessors

SASS is used as the CSS preprocessor.

[GuavaScript](https://github.com/TheEnigmaBlade/guavascript) is used instead of Javascript, but I'm the only one who uses it (it's my own language) so the resulting Javascript is provided.
